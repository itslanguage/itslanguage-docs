# Script to update the ITSLanguage GitHub pages website.
# Inspiration from https://gist.github.com/domenic/ec8b0fc8ab45f39403dd
#
# The script should potentially do two things. It should either update
# the docs for master, or add a version to it.
#
# NOTE:
# Travis has a convenient "pages" provider. This provider works awesome
# and saves the script that is below. BUT it has some drawbacks: you
# can only use it with an personal access token. This way, worst case,
# someone could gain access to the key provider its repositories. So we
# should limit that risk by using this script.
# Also, the default provider does not take multiple versions of
# documentation in account. We do try that with this script.
