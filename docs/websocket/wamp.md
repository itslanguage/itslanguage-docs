# WAMP

The websocket API is implemented using [WAMP] (Web Application Messaging
Protocol). This allows for RPCs over websockets.
To be able to use the websocket API, a WAMP client should be used.
The recommended WAMP client is Autobahn since it's from the author of WAMP.
Other [implementations](http://wamp-proto.org/implementations/) are also
available.
