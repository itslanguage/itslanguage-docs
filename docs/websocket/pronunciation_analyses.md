# Pronunciation Analyses

Performing a pronunciation analysis is broken up into various calls.

## Initialising a pronunciation analysis

This is the starting point for a pronunciation analysis. A unique analysis id
is generated, which serves a leading role in the analysis. Each other call
requires the analysis id as a parameter.

If other RPCs are called without this RPC being called first, the error
`nl.itslanguage.session_not_initialised` will be returned.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.init_analysis
```

### Response

The unique analysis id is returned as a string. The id is used in other calls
to identify the current analysis.

## Initialise pronunciation challenge

Before performing the analysis, the reference audio of the challenge needs to
be prepared. This involves aligning the audio. When the RPC is called, the
challenge is initialised asynchronously. When the challenge is to be used, the
server automatically waits for the challenge initialisation to finish. If the
initialisation results in an error, the error is relayed to the client.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.init_challenge
```

## Fetch reference alignment

The challenge that will be done is registered with a reference audio file to
compare your speech with. This will need to be fetched before being able to send
audio. This reference alignment will be given back to you as an intermediate result.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.alignment
```

## Initialising audio for uploading

The audio that is to be uploaded for analysis is streamed to the server. Some
information is required in order for the server to be able to store and
analyse the audio correctly.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.init_audio
```

### Parameters

Name         | Type     | Description
-------------|----------|------------
analysis_id  | `string` | **Required** The id of the analysis to initialise the audio for.
audio_format | `string` | **Required** The mimetype of the audio to upload.

Depending on the `audio_format`, additional parameters may be required.
Please see [the audio documentation](audio.md) for which audio formats are
supported and what parameters they require.

### Parameters

Name            | Type     | Description
----------------|----------|------------
analysis_id     | `string` | **Required** The id of the analysis to prepare the challenge for.
organisation_id | `string` | **Required** The id of the organisation in which to find the challenge.
challenge_id    | `string` | **Required** The id of the challenge to prepare.


## Stream analysis audio

The audio to be analysed can now be streamed to the server. The streaming
works by repeatedly calling this RPC. Each time the RPC is called, the data
will be appended to an audio file on the server.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.write
```

### Parameters

Name        | Type     | Description
------------|----------|------------
analysis_id | `string` | **Required** The id of the analysis for which to upload the audio.
data        | `bytes`  | **Required** The data to stream to the server. This can be any length.
encoding    | `string` | **Optional** The encoding in which the data is sent. This should be `base64` if the data is base64 encoded.


## Perform the analysis

After completing the streaming of the audio, the analysis can be performed.

### URI

```
nl.itslanguage.pronunciation.analyse
```

### Parameters

Name        | Type     | Description
------------|----------|------------
analysis_id | `string` | **Required** The id of the analysis to perform.

### Response

A JSON object with the analysis results and metadata is returned.

Example:
```json

              "verdict": "moderate"},
             {"graphemes": "D",
              "phonemes": [{"end": 0.63,
                            "ipa": "d",
                            "score": 7.5173,
                            "start": 0.5,

              "score": 7.5173,
              "verdict": "good"}]]}
```

The RPC can return various errors:

* `nl.itslanguage.alignment_failed` If the alignment of the audio failed.
* `nl.itslanguage.analysis_failed` If the analysis of the audio failed.
* `nl.itslanguage.no_such_organisation` If the organisation doesn't exist.
* `nl.itslanguage.no_such_challenge` If the challenge doesn't exist.
