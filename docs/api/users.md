# Users

Users can be managed using the REST API. Only users with administrative
powers can perform these calls.


## Create a user

When creating a user, the user is created at the same level as the current
user. This means that when a top level admin creates a user, a top level user
is created. When the current user resides in an organisation the created user
will be created in that organisation.
When creating a user in a different organisation, the current user needs to
[impersonate](oauth2.md#impersonation) the target organisation.
