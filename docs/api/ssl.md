# Securing Your Connection

ITSLanguage's API is available over both secure (HTTPS) and unsecure connections. The section on [authentication](authentication.md) goes into more detail on when you should use one or the other. Note that cross-domain requests from a web browser should match the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) used by the page the browser is displaying to avoid security warnings.
